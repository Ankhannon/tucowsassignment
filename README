This is a test assignment.

It requires NodeJS and NPM. 

To start the server once all node modules are installed: ./bin/dev_startup.js

The goal of this assignment is to implement a simple list presentation and sorting page. It is a responsive design.
Please see the two mockups in the mockups directory.

You will need to perform three ajax calls to 
'/api/call1', '/api/call2', and '/api/call3'.
These calls are simulated in ajax.js. This file should not be modified.

Each call will return a data object with an array. 
Remove all duplicates and place the result on the left side as per mockup.

No images should be included in your final output. SVGs are ok.

To the right of the list should be three buttons. Each bottom will sort the list in a different way.
1. Alphabetically
2. By character Length
3. By numerical representation (the list is numbers as words, so sort the words as numbers).

For mobile the actions are in the hamburger menu accessed from the top right.

If a button is clicked a second time, reverse the order.

Each button should indicate that it is the active sort state (except when the page first loads). The design of this state is up to you.

Your code should reside within the src/ directory.
You can split your code up into multiple files if you wish.
No other libraries are to be used (vanilla javascript only).

BONUS: Add unit tests to your code using a unit testing framework of your choice.

Once complete. Please zip or tar up your completed assignment (without the node_modules directory) and send it back to us.
